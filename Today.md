## CVE-2017-3599
 Vulnerability in the MySQL Server component of Oracle MySQL (subcomponent: Server: Pluggable Auth). Supported versions that are affected are 5.6.35 and earlier and 5.7.17 and earlier. Easily &quot;exploitable&quot; vulnerability allows unauthenticated attacker with network access via multiple protocols to compromise MySQL Server. Successful attacks of this vulnerability can result in unauthorized ability to cause a hang or frequently repeatable crash (complete DOS) of MySQL Server. CVSS 3.0 Base Score 7.5 (Availability impacts). CVSS Vector: (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). NOTE: the previous information is from the April 2017 CPU. Oracle has not commented on third-party claims that this issue is an integer overflow in sql/auth/sql_authentication.cc which allows remote attackers to cause a denial of service via a crafted authentication packet.
