## CVE-2022-24760
 Parse Server is an open source http web server backend. In versions prior to 4.10.7 there is a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in Parse Server. This vulnerability affects Parse Server in the default configuration with MongoDB. The main weakness that leads to RCE is the Prototype Pollution vulnerable code in the file `DatabaseController.js`, so it is likely to affect Postgres and any other database backend as well. This vulnerability has been confirmed on Linux (Ubuntu) and Windows. Users are advised to upgrade as soon as possible. The only known workaround is to manually patch your installation with code referenced at the source GHSA-p6h4-93qp-jhcm.

## CVE-2020-0890
 A denial of service vulnerability exists when Microsoft Hyper-V on a host server fails to properly validate specific malicious data from a user on a guest operating system.To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker who already has a privileged account on a guest operating system, running as a virtual machine, could run a specially crafted application.The security update addresses the vulnerability by resolving the conditions where Hyper-V would fail to handle these requests., aka 'Windows Hyper-V Denial of Service Vulnerability'. This CVE ID is unique from CVE-2020-0904.
