## CVE-2022-22978
 In Spring Security versions 5.5.6 and 5.5.7 and older unsupported versions, RegexRequestMatcher can easily be misconfigured to be bypassed on some servlet containers. Applications using RegexRequestMatcher with `.` in the regular expression are possibly vulnerable to an authorization bypass.

## CVE-2022-1292
 The c_rehash script does not properly sanitise shell metacharacters to prevent command injection. This script is distributed by some operating systems in a manner where it is automatically executed. On such operating systems, an attacker could execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the script. Use of the c_rehash script is considered obsolete and should be replaced by the OpenSSL rehash command line tool. Fixed in OpenSSL 3.0.3 (Affected 3.0.0,3.0.1,3.0.2). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1o (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1n). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2ze (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2zd).

## CVE-2021-43408
 The &quot;Duplicate Post&quot; WordPress plugin up to and including version 1.1.9 is vulnerable to SQL Injection. SQL injection vulnerabilities occur when client supplied data is included within an SQL Query insecurely. SQL Injection can typically be exploited to read, modify and delete SQL table data. In many cases it also possible to exploit features of SQL server to execute system commands and/or access the local file system. This particular vulnerability can be exploited by any authenticated user who has been granted access to use the Duplicate Post plugin. By default, this is limited to Administrators, however the plugin presents the option to permit access to the Editor, Author, Contributor and Subscriber roles.

## CVE-2021-42013
 It was found that the fix for CVE-2021-41773 in Apache HTTP Server 2.4.50 was insufficient. An attacker could use a path traversal attack to map URLs to files outside the directories configured by Alias-like directives. If files outside of these directories are not protected by the usual default configuration &quot;require all denied&quot;, these requests can succeed. If CGI scripts are also enabled for these aliased pathes, this could allow for remote code execution. This issue only affects Apache 2.4.49 and Apache 2.4.50 and not earlier versions.

## CVE-2021-3560
 It was found that polkit could be tricked into bypassing the credential checks for D-Bus requests, elevating the privileges of the requestor to the root user. This flaw could be used by an unprivileged local attacker to, for example, create a new local administrator. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality and integrity as well as system availability.

## CVE-2021-3156
 Sudo before 1.9.5p2 contains an off-by-one error that can result in a heap-based buffer overflow, which allows privilege escalation to root via &quot;sudoedit -s&quot; and a command-line argument that ends with a single backslash character.

## CVE-2019-8942
 WordPress before 4.9.9 and 5.x before 5.0.1 allows remote code execution because an _wp_attached_file Post Meta entry can be changed to an arbitrary string, such as one ending with a .jpg?file.php substring. An attacker with author privileges can execute arbitrary code by uploading a crafted image containing PHP code in the Exif metadata. Exploitation can leverage CVE-2019-8943.

## CVE-2018-6574
 Go before 1.8.7, Go 1.9.x before 1.9.4, and Go 1.10 pre-releases before Go 1.10rc2 allow &quot;go get&quot; remote command execution during source code build, by leveraging the gcc or clang plugin feature, because -fplugin= and -plugin= arguments were not blocked.
