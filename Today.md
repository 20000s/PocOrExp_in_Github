## CVE-2021-41277
 Metabase is an open source data analytics platform. In affected versions a security issue has been discovered with the custom GeoJSON map (`admin-&gt;settings-&gt;maps-&gt;custom maps-&gt;add a map`) support and potential local file inclusion (including environment variables). URLs were not validated prior to being loaded. This issue is fixed in a new maintenance release (0.40.5 and 1.40.5), and any subsequent release after that. If you&#8217;re unable to upgrade immediately, you can mitigate this by including rules in your reverse proxy or load balancer or WAF to provide a validation filter before the application.
