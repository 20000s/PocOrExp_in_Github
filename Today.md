## CVE-2021-28701
 Another race in XENMAPSPACE_grant_table handling Guests are permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, are de-allocated when a guest switches (back) from v2 to v1. Freeing such pages requires that the hypervisor enforce that no parallel request can result in the addition of a mapping of such a page to a guest. That enforcement was missing, allowing guests to retain access to pages that were freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. Unfortunately, when XSA-379 was being prepared, this similar issue was not noticed.

## CVE-2020-3217
 A vulnerability in the Topology Discovery Service of Cisco One Platform Kit (onePK) in Cisco IOS Software, Cisco IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. The vulnerability is due to insufficient length restrictions when the onePK Topology Discovery Service parses Cisco Discovery Protocol messages. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol message to an affected device. An exploit could allow the attacker to cause a stack overflow, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges, or to cause a process crash, which could result in a reload of the device and cause a DoS condition.

## CVE-2020-3206
 A vulnerability in the handling of IEEE 802.11w Protected Management Frames (PMFs) of Cisco Catalyst 9800 Series Wireless Controllers that are running Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to terminate a valid user connection to an affected device. The vulnerability exists because the affected software does not properly validate 802.11w disassociation and deauthentication PMFs that it receives. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a spoofed 802.11w PMF from a valid, authenticated client on a network adjacent to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to terminate a single valid user connection to the affected device.

## CVE-2020-3204
 A vulnerability in the Tool Command Language (Tcl) interpreter of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker with privileged EXEC credentials to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system (OS) with root privileges. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of data passed to the Tcl interpreter. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by loading malicious Tcl code on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause memory corruption or execute the code with root privileges on the underlying OS of the affected device.

## CVE-2011-1473
 ** DISPUTED ** OpenSSL before 0.9.8l, and 0.9.8m through 1.x, does not properly restrict client-initiated renegotiation within the SSL and TLS protocols, which might make it easier for remote attackers to cause a denial of service (CPU consumption) by performing many renegotiations within a single connection, a different vulnerability than CVE-2011-5094.  NOTE: it can also be argued that it is the responsibility of server deployments, not a security library, to prevent or limit renegotiation when it is inappropriate within a specific environment.
